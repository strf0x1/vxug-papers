    "The program takes a single argument: the path to a binary shellcode file.",
    "It reads the contents of this file using the ReadContents function and allocates memory for it with VirtualAlloc.",
    "The shellcode is then memcpy'd into the allocated memory, which has been set as executable with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE.",
    "NotifyNetworkConnectivityHintChange is called with a callback pointing to the allocated memory, triggering the execution of the shellcode.",
    "The program waits for 2 minutes before exiting."
